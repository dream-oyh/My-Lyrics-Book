Every couple of years now
The doctor says I'm sick
Pulls out a brand-new bag of tricks
And then they lay it on me
Well, at first, it was my brain
Then a skeleton in pain
And I don't like to complain
But I'm saying, "Sorry"
When I met you, I thought I was damaged goods
Had a ****ed up childhood
And there's poison in my brain and in my blood
If you knew it was the end of the world
Could you love me like a child?
Could you hold me in the dark?
If we knew it was the end of the world
Would you like to stay a while?
Would you leave when it gets hard?
So, I ran into the clinic
And I asked to see the man
With his white coat and his stethoscope
Like a snake around his hand
And I told him I'm not bitter
'Cause I finally found a lover
Who is better for my liver
And now I'll finally recover
When I met him, I thought I was damaged goods
From a real bad neighborhood
So we wrestled in the mud
And I told him he could stay right where he stood
But I don't know if he should
'Cause once my god destroys the flesh, then there's the flood
If you knew it was the end of the world
Could you love me like a child?
Could you hold me in the dark?
If we knew it was the end of the world
Would you like to stay a while?
Maybe we could build an ark
We could sail on broken driftwood
Through the sopping wet terrain
And count the buildings and the bodies
Getting swallowed by the rain
And in the water, there's the doctor
Who didn't listen to my claim
Oh, what a shame
He's circling the drain
When I met you, I said I would never die
But the joke was always mine
'Cause I'm racing against time
And I know it's not the end of the world
But could you pick me up at 8?
'Cause my treatment starts today
时光荏苒 每过两三年
医生总宣告我得了病
拿出崭新的把戏包袱
往我身上堆砌
起初是说脑袋
接着是骨头在呻吟
我并非爱抱怨的人
但这次 我不得不说声抱歉
遇见你之前 我一直以为自己是残次品
童年满目疮痍 不堪回首
如今 毒素侵蚀着我的大脑 流淌在我的血液
世界若将倾颓崩塌
你是否还能爱我如孩童般天真？
黑暗笼罩之时 你可愿紧紧将我拥抱？
若晓大难将至
你是否愿意多停留片刻？
当苦难袭来 你会选择悄然离去吗？
于是 我奔向诊所
渴求与那位医生相见
身着白袍的他 手持听诊器
犹如盘绕的手杖
我告诉他 我已全然放下过往的苦涩
因为终于遇见了你 爱人
你让我的肝脏得以复苏
我也终于能迎来真正的康复
当遇见你的时候 我以为自己满目疮痍
来自糟糕透顶的社区
所以我们在泥泞中厮打
我告诉他可以停留在原地
但我不确定他是否应该留下
因为一旦神明摧毁血肉 洪水就会泛滥
世界若将倾颓崩塌
你是否还能爱我如孩童般天真？
黑暗笼罩之时 你可愿紧紧将我拥抱？
若晓大难将至
你是否愿意多停留片刻？
或许我们可以造一座方舟
驶过湿透的土地
依靠破碎的浮木
数着被雨水吞噬的建筑和尸体
而水中漂浮着
那位医生
他从未认真听过我的诉说
噢 多么可耻
他正逐渐沉没
初次见面时 我说自己永生不死
但笑话一直属于我
因为我正与时间赛跑
我知道这不是世界的末日
但是 你能八点来接我吗？
因为我的治疗今天开始
