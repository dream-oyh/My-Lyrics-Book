I left home and moved to Brooklyn where my boyfriend had a place
And he had track marks on his arms but had the most angelic face
I watched my friends die before twenty-one, and now I'm twenty-eight
I'm at the doctor's every day, because I can't stop losing weight
And now I'm the one with needles in my arms and in my legs
I'm making jokes about the blood tests, and I'm planning my estate
And I don't wanna blame the child, but I have to speculate
If this could all just be an answer to those prayers that came delayed
Because I never would have said it, if I knew I'd have to wait
Until the moment I was happy, then it all disintegrates
And I'm singing
"Please, God, I don't wanna be sick
And I don't wanna hurt, so get it over with quick
Please, God, I wanna be loved
Don't wanna be somebody that you're tryna get rid of
Please, God, I don't wanna be sick
And I don't wanna hurt, so get it over with quick
Please, God, I wanna be loved
I don't wanna be somebody you're tryna get rid of"
Thank you
我离开家前往布鲁克林 与男友共居一隅
他手臂针痕斑斑 却拥有天使般纯净的容颜
我眼见朋友们二十一岁前相继凋零 如今我二十八
每日奔走诊所 体重在无声中慢慢消失
如今轮到我双臂双腿插满了针管的冷迹
我调侃血检 却暗自思量着自己的遗产
我不想怪罪那个孩子 但心中不免疑虑
这是否是迟来的祈祷 终于得到回应
如果早知需要如此漫长等待 我绝不会轻易言说
等到那幸福来临的刹那 一切却在瞬间破碎
于是我唱起低语
求你了 神啊 我不愿再病痛缠身
我不想再受折磨 速速终结这一切吧
求你了 神啊 我渴望被爱
不愿成为你心中要弃之不顾的那人
求你了 神啊 我不愿再病痛缠身
我不想再受折磨 速速终结这一切吧
求你了 神啊 我渴望被爱
不愿成为你想抛弃的那个人
谢谢
