My dad is almost home
I can't tell time yet, but I know
Because the air becomes electric and my mother cleans the stove
He'll walk in through the door, and both my eyes will find the floor
And I will search my brain to find something I might get yelled at for
He'll come in with a frown and tell me, "Sit your ass right down"
Or he might get his kicks from joking that he's just playin' around
And in a few years, I will leave, but I'll perpetually believe
That any man who says he loves me is hiding something up his sleeve
Wash me in the water
You can cut off all my hair, and I'll be
Changing like the weather, but I'll never be like him
The other girls date older guys and wear their t-shirts late at night
But everything I own that's oversized belongs to me, it's mine
And I don't have souvenirs of all the earliest of years
I know my father isn't dead, but it don't feel like he's still here
It's strange now that he's grey and getting older by the day
And my eyes tell me that he's harmless despite what my heart has to say
So maybe just forget, maybe move on, don't regret
Or maybe this is just another trick that hasn't happened yet
Wash me in the water
You can cut off all my hair, and I'll be
Changing like the weather, but I'll never be like him
'Cause blood is thick, but water is forever
And I'm stiffer than a board
Lighter than a feather
And that girl will be a problem
Only if you let her
And I left her back home, but I cannot forget her
I thought that it was my fault, and now
Sometimes, I still do
You didn't chase me through the park
So now I'm chasing after you
But I can't keep up the illusion
Or confirm your point of view
No, I can't bare to fake a smile when you walk into the room
'Cause blood is thick, but water is forever
And I'm stiffer than a board
Lighter than a feather
And that girl will be a problem only if you let her
And I left her back home, but I cannot forget her
Wash me in the water
You can cut off all my hair, and I'll be
Changing like the weather, but I'll never be like him
'Cause blood is thick, but water is forever
And I'm stiffer than a board
Lighter than a feather
And that girl will be a problem only if you let her
Yeah, I left her back home, but I cannot forget her
父亲即将归来
虽然尚不能辨识时间
但空气中的电荷告诉我 母亲已开始打扫炉灶
他将推门而入 我的目光将会落向地板
我将竭力搜寻脑海中可能惹怒他的事情
他可能会皱着眉头 命令我：“坐下！”
或者他可能会开玩笑地戏弄我 说他只是在玩耍
再过几年 我将离家远去 但我会永远相信
任何声称爱我的人 心中必有所藏
请将我涤净
你可以剪去我的长发
而我会如天气般变幻 却永远不会成为他
其他女孩与年长男子约会 深夜穿着他们的T恤
而我拥有的所有宽大衣物 都是我自己的
我没有关于童年时光的纪念品
我知道父亲并未逝去 但感觉他不再这里
如今 看着他日渐苍老 感到陌生
尽管内心充满怀疑 但我的眼睛告诉我 他是无害的
或许应该忘记 或许应该继续前行 不要后悔
或者这只是尚未发生的另一个骗局
请将我涤净
你可以剪去我的长发
而我会如天气般变幻 却永远不会成为他
毕竟血缘相连 可流水更恒久
我比磐石坚硬
却比羽毛轻盈
那女孩会成为你的困扰
全看你是否放纵
我把她留在家里 却无法割舍
我曾将过错揽于一身 如今
有时 我仍旧如此
你未曾穿过公园追寻我
所以我如今在追寻你
但我无法再维持这虚假的幻象
也无法苟同你的看法
不 我无法在你看我走进房间时强颜欢笑
毕竟血缘相连 可流水更恒久
我比磐石坚硬
却比羽毛轻盈
那女孩会成为你的困扰 全看你是否放纵
我把她留在家里 却无法割舍
请将我涤净
你可以剪去我的长发
而我会如天气般变幻 却永远不会成为他
毕竟血缘相连 可流水更恒久
我比磐石坚硬
却比羽毛轻盈
那女孩会成为你的困扰 全看你是否放纵
我把她留在家里 却无法割舍
