There's lots of fish out in the pond
In the oceans and the rivers and in all the waterfalls
But if I'm made for land and not the sea at all
Could I crawl and find some kind Neanderthal?
What if I'm from outer space?
And I have fire in my bones and in my veins?
I let it show and scare my suitors far away
Leave them traumatized with visions of its glow behind my face
They say that God makes no mistakes, but I might disagree
When I outstretch my empty hand
I watch them build society, domesticated land
It goes according to the plan
While they're in paradise, I'm exiled in the sand
If everyone has someone, then the math just isn't right
And I'm the only outlier, the lonely archetype
If everything is by design, well, I might disagree
You all know something that I don't
You all learned something that I fear I'll never know
You all grew body parts I fear I'll never grow
You all know something that I don't
You all know something that I don't
You all know something that I don't
What if I'm just cosmic dust?
Put me in a metal box that's bound to rust
Shoot me into space and leave me to combust
Return to earth and just dissolve into its crust
Well, I was born all by myself
It's not unlikely that I'll die that way as well
鱼儿遍布池塘
汪洋大海 瀑布飞流
可是 若我生于陆地 而非海洋深处
能否爬行 寻觅善良的尼安德特人？
或许我来自外太空
体内燃烧着火焰 流淌着炽热血液
我若展现光芒 恐吓追求者远去
留下他们心有余悸 脑海中浮现我脸后发光的幻象
他们言道 上帝不会犯错 但我或许不同意
当我伸出空虚之手
我目睹他们建立社会 驯化土地
一切按计划进行
当他们身处天堂 我却流落在沙地
若人人皆有伴侣 则算术必有误
而我便是唯一的异类 孤独的典范
若一切皆有定数 我或许仍不同意
你们皆知我所不知
你们皆学得我恐难学之物
你们皆长出我恐难长之躯体
你们皆知我所不知
你们皆知我所不知
你们皆知我所不知
若我仅为宇宙尘埃
置我于锈蚀金属盒中
射我入太空 任我自焚
归于地球 化为尘土
我生于世 孑然一身
或将如此孤寂地死去
