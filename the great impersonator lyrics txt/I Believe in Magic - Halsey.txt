My son is almost three
He used to look just like his dad, but right now he looks just like me
And as far as I can see
The fruit I bear is sweet
But the apple's rolling real far from the tree
And falling down the hill so full of love and so carefree
I wonder if the world will treat him any better than it treated me
Well Papa, don't you preach
I try to teach him every day that nothing good is free, but oh, it should be
And with all my roots above
And all my branches down below
Please tell my boy I love him so
Please tell the world I have to grow before I go
Well, I just wanted you to know
That I believe in magic and I believe in sin
I still believe in Heaven if they'll never let me in
I started to believe in love the day I met my little twin
I think I might start tryin'
Because I haven't been
My mama's getting old
Well, it's contagious and you catch it like a cold
She won't admit it, but it's something that I know
'Cause every year that passes for me passes her a hundredfold
Back in the day
My dad and I would share a laugh at all of her mistakes
But that alliance didn't save me from her fate
No, I didn't last till twenty-eight
Became a single mom, just crushed under the weight
Of a child growing faster than I think that I can take
I love him anyway
And I remind myself a time will come when he sees me turn grey
And realizes too late
Like I did with my mother
So now I tell her to her face
With all my roots above
And all my branches down below
Please tell my mom I love her so
Please tell the world I have to grow before I go
Well, I just wanted you to know
That I believe in magic and I still believe in sin
I still believe in Heaven if they'll never let me in
I started to believe in love the day I met my little twin
And I might start tryin'
Because I haven't been
I haven't been
But I love him so
我的儿子即将三岁，
他曾经长得像极了他的父亲，但现在却像我。
就我所见，
我结出的果实甜美，
但那苹果却滚得离树甚远，
沿着充满爱与无忧无虑的山坡落下。
我在想这个世界是否会比对我更好地对待他。
哦，爸爸，请别教训，
我每天都试图教他，美好的事物并非免费可得，尽管它们本应如此。
我的根向上延伸，
枝条则向下生长，
请告诉他我有多么爱他，
请告诉世界，在离开之前我必须成长。
我只是想让你知道，
我相信奇迹也相信罪恶，
即使他们永不让我进入天堂，我仍相信它的存在。
自从遇见了我的小宝贝，我开始相信爱。
我想我也许该尝试，
因为我从未这样做过。
我的母亲日渐老去，
衰老如同感冒般传染开来。
她不会承认，但我心中明白，
回想过去，
我和父亲曾笑谈她的种种失误，
但那份默契并未能使我免于同样的命运。
不，我未能撑到二十八岁，
成为了单身母亲，在重压下崩溃，
孩子成长的速度超过了我能承受的范围。
无论如何，我还是爱着他，
我提醒自己总有一天他会看到我满头白发，
然后迟来的意识到，
就像我对我的母亲那样。
所以我现在当面对她说，
我的根向上延伸，
枝条则向下生长，
请告诉她我有多么爱她，
请告诉世界，在离开之前我必须成长。
我只是想让你知道，
我相信奇迹也相信罪恶，
即使他们永不让我进入天堂，我仍相信它的存在。
自从遇见了我的小宝贝，我开始相信爱。
而我也许该尝试，
因为我从未这样做过，
虽然我未曾做到，
但我如此深爱着他。
