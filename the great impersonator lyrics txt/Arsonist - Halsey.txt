Arsonist, burning down the world to feel its heat
The arsonist doesn't feel the embers on his feet, and
Arsonist, your human starter kit came incomplete
My apologies, arsonist, you loved me
I'm glued to a building that's on fire
Handcuffed to a narcissistic liar
Empty space and lethargy
Eyes aglaze with apathy
Fool me twice, the shame is on me
Am I a victim in your game?
Am I a set of antique plates?
Will you pass me through your bloodline with your ornamental rage?
Can I take the blame for everything you hate?
The punishment and crime are not the same
Arsonist, burning down the world to feel its heat
The arsonist doesn't feel the embers on his feet, and
Arsonist, your human starter kit came incomplete
My apologies, arsonist, you loved me
You built a small container to keep all of me confined
I am water, I am shapeless, I am fluid, I'm divine
Somebody will love me for the way that I'm designed
Devastation, creation intertwined
You don't love the flames, you just want them for yourself
Douse my head in kerosene, horizon into hell
And you smothered out the glow I grew for you
But it was mine too
Arsonist, burning down the world to feel its heat
The arsonist doesn't feel the embers on his feet, and
Arsonist, your human starter kit came incomplete
My apologies, arsonist, you loved me
Alchemy's not love, it's playing God
And there's a penance paid for entering a temple like a fraud in your charade
You leave me sleeping in the dark so you can hide away your blade
Then lock the door and trap me right here in the blaze
Arsonist, burning down the world to feel its heat
The arsonist doesn't feel the embers on his feet, and
Arsonist, your human starter kit came incomplete
My apologies, arsonist, you loved me
Have you ever—
Have you ever been worried that if you—
Have you ever given the world to somebody as a gift and had it returned?
Did you know the father's DNA stays inside the mother for seven years?
Have you ever waited seven years?
Have you ever woken from a dream just to realize that you were still asleep?
Do you ever wish that you were still asleep?
Do you ever wish you wouldn't wake up?
纵火者 为感受温暖而点燃世界
纵火者 不觉双脚被余烬灼伤
纵火者 你的灵魂残缺 缺乏善意
抱歉 纵火者 你曾爱过我
我被困于烈火熊熊的高楼
铐在自恋骗子的身旁
空虚笼罩 倦怠侵蚀
目光呆滞 毫无生机
上当受骗 羞愧难当
我是否成了你游戏中的牺牲品？
我是否只是一套古董瓷器？
你是否会用你矫饰的怒火将我传宗接代？
我能否为你的万般憎恨背负罪名？
惩罚与罪行 怎能划上等号？
纵火者 为感受温暖而点燃世界
纵火者 不觉双脚被余烬灼伤
纵火者 你的灵魂残缺 缺乏善意
抱歉 纵火者 你曾爱过我
你为我筑起狭小的囚笼 试图将我禁锢
我如水无形 流转不定 神圣非凡
终会有心人 欣赏我独一无二的姿态
毁灭与创造 交织缠绵
你并不爱火焰 只为私欲而点燃
你将我浇灌桐油 将天际推入地狱
你熄灭了我为你而生的光芒
可那光芒 也属于我
纵火者 为感受温暖而点燃世界
纵火者 不觉双脚被余烬灼伤
纵火者 你的灵魂残缺 缺乏善意
抱歉 纵火者 你曾爱过我
炼金术并非爱 而是对神的亵渎
你假装虔诚 闯入圣地 必将受到惩罚
你让我在黑暗中沉睡 好掩藏你的利刃
而后锁上房门 将我困在这熊熊烈火之中
纵火者 为感受温暖而点燃世界
纵火者 不觉双脚被余烬灼伤
纵火者 你的灵魂残缺 缺乏善意
抱歉 纵火者 你曾爱过我
你是否曾——
你是否曾担心 若你——
你是否曾将全世界作为礼物赠予他人 却换来失望？
你可知 父亲的 DNA 在母亲体内停留七年？
你是否曾等待七年？
你是否曾从梦中醒来 却发现仍未脱离梦境？
你是否曾渴望仍沉睡不醒？
你是否曾希望永远不再醒来？
