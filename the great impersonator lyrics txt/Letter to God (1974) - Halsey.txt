I don't wanna go to grandma's
So I'm quiet on the drive
I don't wanna go to grandma's
So I'm quiet on the drive
I saw a deer that must've gotten hit
It made me start to cry
Did he have a mom and dad
And do they argue just like mine?
Did he have a little brother that annoyed him all the time?
Did he wanna be a grown-up?
Did he wanna be a grown-up?
Were there trees he liked to climb?
There was a boy I went to school with who had leukemia at five
Now his parents give him everything
They never yell or fight
Never make him cut his hair
'Cause they're happy he survived
He didn't have to clean his room
It was enough to be alive
When I was little, I was jealous
And I'd say a prayer at night
Well, I'd say
"Please, God, I wanna be sick
But I don't wanna hurt so get it over with quick
Please, God, I wanna be loved
I don't wanna be somebody that they wanna get rid of
Please, God, I wanna be sick
I don't wanna hurt so get it over with quick
Please, God, I wanna be loved
I don't wanna be somebody they wanna get rid of"
我不想去祖母家
所以开车时我很安静
我不想去祖母家
所以开车时我很安静
我看到了一只鹿 一定是撞到了它
这让我开始哭泣
他有自己的父母吗
他们会像我的父母一样吵架吗？
他有一个一直烦他的弟弟吗？
他想成为大人吗？
他想成为大人吗？
他喜欢爬树吗？
我有一个学校的朋友 他在五岁时患了白血病
现在他的父母会给他一切
他们从不吵架或打架
从不让他剪头发
因为他们很高兴他活了下来
他不必打扫房间
活着就足够了
当我小的时候 我很嫉妒
我会在晚上祈祷
我会说
上帝 我也想生病
但我不想要受伤 所以快点结束吧
上帝 我想被爱
我不想成为他们想要摆脱的人
上帝 我也想生病
但我不想要受伤 所以快点结束吧
上帝 我想被爱
我不想成为他们想要摆脱的人
