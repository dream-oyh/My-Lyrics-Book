I am so lucky
Everybody, get in line
To meet the girl who flew too high
Who does it all just to be liked
By strangers that she met online
Did it all to be included
My self-loathing's so deep-rooted
Inner child that's unrecruited
Truth is, I'm not suited for it
When I die, I won't have time to spend my money
But I hope that you still love me
'Cause I'm so lucky
I'm a star
But I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
Why they come?
Why they come?
Why they come?
Why they come?
And why she losing so much weight?
I heard it's from the drugs she ate
And I feel her, but I can't relate
'Cause I'd never end up in that state
A girl like that is a mother
Must be tough
A problem child, I was rough
But what do you do with a difficult grownup?
When I die, I won't have time to spend my money
But I hope that you still love me (Da-da-da-da, da-da-mm)
'Cause I'm so lucky (I'm so lucky)
I'm a star
But I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
I shaved my head four times because I wanted to
And then I did it one more time 'cause I got sick (I am so lucky)
And I thought I'd changed so much, nobody would notice it
And no one did
Then I left the doctor's office full of tears
Became a single mom at my premiere
And I told everybody I was fine for a whole damn year
And that's the biggest lie of my career
But I'm so lucky
I'm a star
But I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
I'm so lucky
I'm a star
But I cry, cry, cry in my lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
She's so lucky
She's so lucky
She's so lucky
She's so—
Haven't you heard?
我竟如此幸运
每个人 排队来见
那个飞得太高的女孩
她为博得网络上陌生人的欢心
倾尽所有
她渴望融入
自卑如影随形
未曾被唤醒的稚心
真相是我并不适合
当我死去 无暇挥霍金钱
但我希望你依然爱我
因为我如此幸运 我是颗星
却在孤独的心底哭泣 哭泣 哭泣 想着
“若生命无缺失
为何泪水夜里降临？”
（为何？为何？）
为何降临？
为何降临？
为何降临？
为何降临？
为何她消瘦至此？
听闻是药物所害
我感同身受 却无法共情
因我绝不会堕入那境地
这样的女孩 该是个母亲
定是倔强
野性孩童 我也曾如此
可成年后的她 该如何应对？
当我死去 无暇挥霍金钱
但我希望你依然爱我
因为我如此幸运（我如此幸运）
我是颗星
却在孤独的心底哭泣 哭泣 哭泣 想着
“若生命无缺失
为何泪水夜里降临？”
我四度剃光头 只因渴望改变
第五次剃光 因病魔缠身（我如此幸运）
我以为巨变后
无人认出 可无人察觉
我泪流满面走出医馆
首映礼上 成了单身母亲
整整一年 对所有人报以无恙
那是人生最大的谎言
我如此幸运（我如此幸运）
我是颗星
却在孤独的心底哭泣 哭泣 哭泣 想着
“若生命无缺失
为何泪水夜里降临？”
我如此幸运（我如此幸运）
我是颗星
却在孤独的心底哭泣 哭泣 哭泣 想着
“若生命无缺失
为何泪水夜里降临？”
她如此幸运
她如此幸运
她如此幸运
她如此
