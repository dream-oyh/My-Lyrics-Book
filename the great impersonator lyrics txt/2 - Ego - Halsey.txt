I'm caught up in the everyday trend
Tied up by invisible thread
Walking down a razor-thin edge
And I wake up tired, think I'm better off dead
Been a few months since I crossed over state lines
Talk to my mom, fake smiles over FaceTime
Drink all night till I can't walk a straight line
Feel so low, but I'm high at the same time
I can't keep my feet on the ground
And I'm nervous what you'll think of me now
I'm hoping that someone comes around
And helps me figure it out
I think that I should try to kill my ego
'Cause if I don't, my ego might kill me
I'm all grown up but somehow lately
I'm acting like a ****ing baby
I'm really not as happy as I seem
Still a little kid that can't make friends
Wanna be invited, but I won't attend
I been having bad dreams, my career could end
'Cause I slip up when I should've played pretend
Turned eighteen, and I left the city
I said "I wanna be cool, I don't wanna be pretty"
The voices all came crashing down
And said, "You're too nice to run this town"
I can't keep my feet on the ground
And I'm nervous what you'll think of me now
I'm hoping that someone comes around
And helps me figure it out
I think that I should try to kill my ego
'Cause if I don't my ego might kill me
I'm all grown up but somehow lately
I'm acting like a ****ing baby
I'm really not as happy as I seem
Nothing's as it seems
Yeah, nothing's as it seems
And I'm all grown up but somehow lately
I'm acting like a ****ing baby
I'm really not that happy being me
I don't like the lie I'm living
I'm way too nice and too forgiving
I wanna go back to the beginning
When it all felt right
A rooftop, Lower East Side, I'm singing
Didn't give a **** if I was winning
It's all done now, so who am I kidding?
I'm doing way worse than I'm admitting
I think that I should try to kill my ego
'Cause if I don't my ego might kill me
I'm all grown up but somehow lately
I'm acting like a ****ing baby
I'm really not as happy as I seem
Nothing's as it seems
Yeah, nothing's as it seems
And I'm all grown up but somehow lately
I'm acting like a ****ing baby
I'm really not that happy being me
我被每日热搜裹挟
受无形丝线束缚
走在刀锋之上 步履维艰
醒来疲惫不堪 恍惚间竟生出死志
四处奔波 跨越州界已数月
跟妈妈视频 强颜欢笑 内心苦涩
夜夜买醉 走路踉踉跄跄
心如死灰 却又飘飘欲仙
我心浮气躁 没办法脚踏实地
惶恐不安 担心你会轻视我
盼望有人相助
为我指点迷津
我该扼杀自我 收敛傲慢之心
若是不这样自救 必遭反噬
年岁渐长 可是近来
我却幼稚如顽童
强颜欢笑 内心苦楚
我仍稚气未脱 交友困难
渴望受人邀请 却又胆怯退缩
噩梦缠身 事业岌岌可危
怪自己虚情假意 错失良机
十八岁时 我离开了这座城
我曾说过 “我要酷 不要美”
内心的声音 如雷轰鸣
告诫我 “你太善良 没法主宰这座城”
我心浮气躁 没办法脚踏实地
惶恐不安 担心你会轻视我
盼望有人相助
为我指点迷津
我该扼杀自我 收敛傲慢之心
若是不这样自救 必遭反噬
年岁渐长 可是近来
我却幼稚如顽童
强颜欢笑 内心苦楚
我其实没那么快乐
Yeah 一切并非表面那样
我却幼稚如顽童
强颜欢笑 内心苦楚
我其实没有真正接纳与享受自我
我厌恶虚伪的生活
我过于善良 过于宽容
我渴望回到最初的起点
旧时光是那样美好
屋顶之上 下东区 我唱着歌
才不在乎什么输赢
一切已成过去 我又在骗谁呢？
既然自欺欺人 那就自食其果
我该扼杀自我 收敛傲慢之心
若是不这样自救 必遭反噬
年岁渐长 可是近来
我却幼稚如顽童
强颜欢笑 内心苦楚
我其实没那么快乐
Yeah 一切并非表面那样
我却幼稚如顽童
强颜欢笑 内心苦楚
我其实没有真正接纳与享受自我
