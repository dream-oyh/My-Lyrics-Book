Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
My body carries sadness that my brain cannot yet see
And I've been holding on to memories in my stomach and my teeth
And both my shoulders have been burdened by the weight of my mistakes
And every time you lean in closer, both my knees can't help but shake
And I think you're a danger to my health, or so it seems
Is it love or a panic attack?
Is a heavy heart too much to hold?
I don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home
Is it love or a panic attack?
Would you mind if I asked you on the phone?
I don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home
Mm-mm
I had to call the doctor, left a note on his machine
Because I tripped when we went walking and I felt it in my spleen
Now I think I need a blood test or an antihistamine
Because you make me ****ing nervous
And I don't know what it all means
And I think you're a danger to my health, or so it seems
Is it love or a panic attack?
Is a heavy heart too much to hold?
I don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home
Is it love or a panic attack?
Would you mind if I asked you on the phone?
I don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home
My spirit has been broken
My optimism's getting sore
And I would love to love you
But my body's keepin' score
And I don't know if I can see you anymore
Is it love, is it love (Is it love, is it love, is it love?)
Is it love, is it love (Is it love, is it love?)
Is it love or a panic attack?
Is a heavy heart too much to hold?
I don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home
Is it love or a panic attack?
Would you mind if I asked you on the phone?
I don't know, but it's late, so I'm taking you home
嗚 嗚 嗚 嗚 嗚
嗚 嗚 嗚 嗚 嗚 嗚
我身体藏着难言的悲伤 心却依旧不曾触及
记忆深锁在腹中 仿佛时间也无法抹去
压在双肩的是往昔的沉重 让人难以喘息
你靠近时 我的膝盖颤抖如风中的枯叶
你也许是我心中的祸根 这似乎无可置疑
这是爱 还是恐惧在心头徘徊不息
那颗沉重的心 是否早已不堪重负
我无从知晓 夜色如潮 我带你回家
这是爱 还是无声的惶恐
如果我在电话中问你 你可会在意
我无从知晓 夜已深沉 我带你回家
嗯~
我拨通了医生 留下了匆匆话语
我们漫步时失足 那痛如针刺脾脏
也许我该验个血 可能还得服些药
你让我惶恐不安 如潮水般涌来
可这份感觉 我竟无法解读
你也许是我心中的祸根 这似乎无可置疑
这是爱 还是心中的恐惧悄然滋生
那颗压抑的心 是否早已不堪重负
我无从知晓 夜色如墨 我只能牵你走向归途
这是爱 还是无尽的恐惧
如果我问你 你会在意吗
我无从知晓 夜已深沉 我只能牵你走向归途
我的灵魂早已散落尘埃
乐观在岁月中渐渐枯竭
我曾想要爱你
可这躯体上 满布的伤痕铭刻着时间的烙印
我不知道 是否还能与你重逢
这是爱吗 是爱吗 还是虚幻的影子迷了双眼
这是爱吗 是爱吗 还是无形的幻象困了心田
这是爱 还是心中的恐惧悄然滋生
那颗沉重的心 是否早已不堪重负
我无从知晓 夜色如墨 我只能牵你走向归途
这是爱 还是心中的恐惧悄然滋生
如果我在电话中问你 你是否愿意回应这段彷徨
我无从得知 但在这无尽的夜色中 我仍牵着你走向归途
